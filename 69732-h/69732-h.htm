</div>

<p class="center">JAMES F. JACKSON</p>

<p class="center">Superintendent of Charities and Correction, Cleveland, Ohio</p>


<p>The old type institution for misdemeanants
failed to accomplish satisfactory
results, mental, moral and physical.
It seemed incapable of developing industry;
it was unhygienic, without classification
and with no adequate facilities
for developing a man’s will or increasing
his capacity to do right. There was
no individualism. The old workhouse
was typical of the most intensified institutionalism,
and institutionalism for an
adult is an assured failure. Neither the
arrangements of the building nor the
manner of life nor the administration
were conducive to the rehabilitation of
the man. The old type of workhouse
was constructed to avenge the wrong
and not to correct the wrong doer.</p>

<p>When the failure of that plan was
fully recognized, people cast about for a
remedy. They saw the success and satisfaction
attending the location of charitable
institutions in the country, and the
idea of similar locations for various
types of prisons occurred to them. And
the cry against prison-made goods gave
impetus to the movement.</p>

<p>The prison did seem to be the last
place to make real the fact that “a man’s
a man for a’ that.” But when the plowshare
and the pruning hook began to supplant
the stripes and the dungeon, people
were certain that at last the dignity
of manhood would be realized and that
life and immortality were come to light.</p>

<p>St. Paul and Minneapolis were among
the first to adopt the farm policy. Various
other corrective institutions were established
upon farms in foreign countries
and in this country, especially within
the past twenty years. One of the
best institutions for misdemeanants thus
established was located at Witzwyl,
Switzerland, in 1891. But I wish today
to speak with particular reference
to Cleveland’s situation, its old workhouse
and its new correction farm.</p>

<p>The Cleveland workhouse was constructed
over forty years ago on the old
lines for 500 prisoners, two miles from
the centre of the city. In 1904 and
1905, about 750 acres were purchased
by the city nine miles from its centre.
Upon this land building was commenced
several years later. Thus far there is
built only the “service building” which
at present fulfills all purposes. Ultimately,
it is to be used for storerooms,
and shops. There are also to be built
dormitories for trusties and semi-trusties,
cell-blocks for the least tractable,
kitchens, dining rooms, a chapel, women’s
industrial building, school building
and a greenhouse, all within a high
wall enclosing eleven acres. The present
intention is that the buildings and
wall shall be constructed by the labor of
inmates. Unfortunately there are no
funds in sight to proceed with this construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>All commitments are made to the
original workhouse in the city. There
the women remain, but about two-fifths
of the men are transferred to the correction
farm. On a recent day the 102
men at the correction farm were assigned
to work as follows: on construction
of the sewage disposal plant, 24;
in the stone quarry, 7; on the farm, 10;
in the garden, 7; driving teams (working
the farm and hauling material to the
filter bed), 12; care of horses and stock,
10; to work on the adjoining infirmary
farm, 10; firemen, 2; carpenter, 1; barber,
1; and in the preparation and serving
of the meals and care of the buildings
and grounds, 18. Some of these
last eighteen are unable to do heavy
work, but all have fresh air and sunshine
daily. At other times men do concreting,
making artificial stone, fertilize
and drain the land, which is not fertile,
make roads on the farm and later they
will construct the wall and buildings,
plant trees and perform every sort of
labor that will develop the land, and
cause it to be highly productive and attractive
in appearance. I also hope that
later they will make and repair the
needed wagons, tools and all the smaller
farm implements; in fact they now do
some of that work, especially the repairing.</p>

<p>An apple orchard and much small
fruit have just been planted under the
direction of the state agricultural department.
Last year by attention to
pruning, spraying and smudge fires on
cold nights, ours was one of the few orchards
bearing fruit in all that region.
Bee culture will be introduced and scientific
forestation is to be developed. We
are about to construct a dairy barn entirely
by prison labor, that will be a
model of simplicity, sanitary construction
and efficiency for the neighboring
country.</p>

<p>We propose that the farm shall gradually
become a model in all respects. In
fact, this year we will produce certified
milk for the city and the contagious disease
hospitals. We plan, as soon as possible,
that the correction farm shall produce
the meat, milk, vegetables and
fruit, both fresh and canned, for the entire
workhouse and the public hospitals,
while the adjoining infirmary farm will
render similar service for its own use
and that of the growing tuberculosis
sanatorium.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the prisoner,
the farm policy is to give to each man
the largest degree of liberty consistent
with the well-being of others. The ultimate
purpose is to employ as many
without the walls as possibly can be
trusted, and to employ out-of-doors
within the walls all the remainder except
those whose conduct imperatively
demands closest supervision.</p>

<p>For years there will be work for all
workers, no “idle-house” in any sort of
weather or trade conditions. Every
working day from twelve to twenty men
are sent to work on the adjoining infirmary
farm. Such transfer was one
of the purposes of placing the infirmary
on a great contiguous tract of land. But
the plan works to the detriment of the
correction farm which for years and
perhaps always can use to advantage the
labor of all men committed to its care.
No key is turned on these men during
the day. The night guard and the locked
door are more to remove temptation
than to prevent escape. You realize this
when you know that all these men, instead
of sleeping in stuffy cells, sleep in
large dormitories, giving them every facility
for overpowering the night watch
and making their escape. Prisoners arrive
a typical bridewell company, drunken,
dirty, diseased and discouraged.
They go away bronzed, with regular
habits of living, accustomed to work,
with a new determination and a new
grip. Of course some fail, and return.
But we do not assume to insure immunity
against all the wiles of the world,
the flesh and the devil.</p>

<p>Americans seem in constant search
for a cure-all. There is a great demand
for some hobby for the alert philanthropist
to ride. In their order institutionalism,
organized charity, juvenile
courts, medical charities and country life
have had their turn in the spot light.
Each is efficient but all together are not
sufficient. It is urged that if a convict
be sent out under the blue sky to breathe
God’s pure air, behold green fields and
hear the birds sing from the swaying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
boughs he will become as one of the
best citizens, especially if he digs in the
dirt. But unfortunately the country does
not afford the alchemy which converts
men into angels. This is amply attested
by the record of most diabolical crimes
committed by country-bred men who
would not know an elevator from a subway.
The farm prison is no panacea, but
it is tremendously worth while.</p>

<p>The men do not wear stripes in either
prison. Consideration is combined with
firmness in all our dealings, for it is the
purpose that every requirement shall appeal
to the fair-minded prisoner to be
in his interest and for his benefit.</p>

<p>From the experience of the Cleveland
correction farm several rather obvious
deductions may be made; we are dealing
with men, free moral agents, and a good
physical environment does not guarantee
their reform any more than does instruction
in good rules for living.</p>

<p>We have learned that men are sent to
the House of Correction for a purpose.
These men have faults to be corrected.
These defects in the human mind are to
be corrected and no ordinary workhouse
sentence will effect a cure of such defects
as are hereditary or fully acquired.
There is some concealed materialism
abroad under the guise of environment,
but the rankest exponent of environment
should not expect to cure twenty
years of bad surroundings accompanied
by indifferent or bad actions even by a
ninety day period on a farm. And ninety
days is in excess of the average period
of confinement, although Cleveland
“golden rule policies” do not burden us
with five, ten or fifteen day men.</p>

<p>Our first appeal is to their sense of
honor. Their appreciation of the confidence
reposed in them often proves a
potent influence for good. The transfer
to the farm is such an expression of
confidence. But it is given with discretion.
Hardened criminals are not sent
on distant missions unattended. In fact
they are rarely transferred to the farm.</p>

<p>As a part of their teaching the misdemeanants
need discipline. It is necessary
to keep the men on the farm for
some time if they are to receive the
needed development, especially the men
who are sent for intoxication. Discipline
is essential to instruction whether
in the day school, the home or any other
form of education. Many of these men
are committed because of their lack of
self-control and time is required for its
development. We have learned that the
men need to be taught the habit of industry
and how to do some particular
thing well. This is for their good while
they are on the farm, and it is essential
after they return to their homes. We
have learned that not all men can be
trusted, and we believe it has a bad influence
on a man to attempt to get away,
so we make him feel the bad result when
he is caught. And the police are faithful
to help catch deserters. Personality
is a big factor; one man will accomplish
far more with and for prisoners than another.</p>

<p>The farm does build up the body of
the anaemic; it gives a good physical
development. Moreover, the habit of
industry can very much better be taught
where results are being achieved on the
farm than where work is being done at
little or no profit in a factory. And efficiency
is better developed on the farm.
The farm has a direct physical value
and an indirect mental and moral value.
It clears a man’s mind and allows him
to think straight. It affords a foundation
for developing the spiritual structure,
though of itself it will only slightly
develop one mentally or morally. The
man is now physically well, having had
lessons in life. Here is the opportunity
to further develop his will in order that
he may do right. Looking to that end,
we have introduced the regular presentation
of the gospel in an orderly way.
We intend to teach by example, but we
need an official who shall be recognized
by the prisoners as their friend, one who
shall know them and make it his exclusive
business to help them establish the
desire to do right and aid them to be
able to fulfill that desire. This seems
one of the unsolved problems in Cleveland
and in nearly all such institutions.</p>

<p>We have the parole system in operation,
though there is not help enough
for its most efficient execution. There
is the Brotherhood Club for the men
who have no home to which to go, established
at the suggestion of a former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
prisoner. There a man may stay until
he appears strong enough to live a normal
life. The club is intended to be
self-sustaining.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the country is the
place for the misdemeanant, for the
very obvious reason that it affords plenty
of light, pure air, a variety of good
food and wide opportunity for productive
occupation for the prisoners. There,
work is purposeful, not a time-killer.
They work, eat, sleep, have recreation
and religious teaching, all under approximately
normal conditions. Every
man is treated with kindness and consideration;
discipline is not on parade.
In short, the prisoner is treated like a
man and to the extent that there is
manhood in him it will come out. The
purpose is to develop honor and faithfulness,
to accustom every man to useful
occupation and to teach him to be
effective. The officers are not armed,
they are not even called guards. In fact,
they act as teachers, foremen, or farmers
as the occasion requires.</p>

<p>There is so much work to do in developing,
enriching and cultivating the
land, in erecting buildings, in making
roads, that every feasible labor-saving
machine is used. This of itself speaks
to the man the appreciation of his work
as a man and not a substitute for a machine.</p>

<p>The hope is that the farming and the
making of its equipment, and incidentally
the care of the prisoners and their
quarters, will profitably occupy practically
all the available labor in such manner
as to make a man not only fit but
anxious to work. It is hoped that a large
majority will be improved and many rehabilitated
in an environment which
favors giving every man all the chance
he will use to reform. Moreover, it
will thereby be apparent that the government
is not only strong, but so merciful
and so genuine in its fatherly desire
to help each man that in turn he will
cease to be “agin” the government; that
he will turn from being a consumer to
become a producer of taxes, turn from
being his own and other’s enemy to become
a friend to men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_KANSAS_CITY_IS_DOING">WHAT KANSAS CITY IS DOING</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">E. K. BINGHAM</p>

<p class="center">Superintendent Helping Hand Institute, Kansas City, Mo.</p>


<p>Kansas City made great strides toward
a better handling of its misdemeanants
when it created a new municipal
department called the Board of
Public Welfare, and placed its correctional
institutions under its control. The
board at first was appointed by the
mayor, it is self-elective and some of its
members were social workers, some
broad-minded business men, and its first
president was a most excellent organizer,
a philanthropist and a man of great
personal devotion to the cause of humanity.</p>

<p>The newspapers unanimously supported
its policies and consequently it
received the popular indorsement which
freed it from political handicaps. These
facts have been the combination which
accomplished results which were unusual
in its less than two years existence.
Its pivotal activity has been a
farm colony (which of course we all
agree is the indispensable feature of effective
correctional work). Of course,
also, like other farms, it builds up the
under-nourished, gives care to the
physically unfit, and also, whether by
farm work or in learning a trade, the
work habit which is acquired helps
largely in rekindling the spark of ambition
in the man whom repeated failure
has utterly robbed of the power of initiation
and confidence in himself. Another
help is that no man is ever released
penniless, but is allowed to earn
something during the last few days of
his imprisonment. But the greatest factor
which has contributed to a more successful
handling of cases has been the
emphasis placed upon the individual
man. A careful personal record system
with daily notations of a prisoner’s conduct
and facts concerning his mental,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
moral and physical condition permits a
scrutiny and a kind of helpfulness otherwise
impossible.</p>

<p>The records also are examined by a
parole committee of three members
which meets weekly and recommends
certain paroles to be acted upon by the
Board of Welfare. A representative of
the parole committee visits the “holdovers”
at five o’clock each morning,
talks with each prisoner, and makes out
record cards which are taken into the
municipal court by this same representative,
who, sitting beside the judge, is
frequently asked for information when
prisoners are brought in, his record
often deciding the sentence imposed.</p>

<p>Forty-six per cent. of the commitments
for 1910 were paroled—or 1,660
persons—of whom 150 were returned to
custody. Nine parole officers confirm
the records by weekly visits to the
homes or places of employment, and a
woman friendly visitor looks after the
needs of prisoners’ families during their
imprisonment and also during the prisoner’s
parole. From non-support paroled
men $8,346.21 was collected and
paid over to the dependent families.</p>

<p>During the past winter it occurred to
me that the city needed an inspector of
the unemployed, a policeman without a
club, who should go every day among
the homeless men in the lodging houses,
saloons and on the street and talk with
them, directing them to pay jobs if possible,
or if not, directing them to the
municipal quarries in the parks, which
were operated to provide work to the
unemployed, for 150 to 340 men a day
earning meal and lodging tickets there
at the usual rate paid for rock cracking.
Or if the man was found to be making
no effort to find work, after several days
this officer, being familiar with the
facts, could arrest for vagrancy. This
idea was suggested to a police commissioner
and an inspector of the unemployed
was appointed. In addition to
the above duties, he goes into municipal
court each day, appearing as an advocate
of many homeless men, a class so
often unjustly accused and arrested on
circumstantial evidence. His desk is in
the employment office which is financed
by the Board of Welfare, but is managed
by and is in the Helping Hand Institute
(a private charity which the
Board of Welfare uses as a municipal
lodging house for meals and lodging for
all dependent cases.) The seven hundred
men per day who lodge there are
practically under the eye of this inspector
of the unemployed, and the deterrent
effect for the misdemeanant is evident.</p>

<p>Among other classes of misdemeanants
that Kansas City is reaching is the
lodging house keeper, his misdeeds being
brought to light by the housing inspection
now in progress.</p>

<p>The endorsement of the Charities Bureau,
or rather the lack of its endorsement,
is eliminating the unwise free
soup charities and the soliciting frauds—these
are of course among the very
harmful offenders because of the shiftlessness
which they promote. At the
suggestion of this Bureau the police
have stopped the practice of women soliciting
money in saloons.</p>

<p>Another class is handled by the Recreation
Department of the Board of Welfare,
as evidenced by the dance hall inspection.
For every public dance a
license must be secured from this recreation
department. This department
then sends an inspector to each dance to
learn if all its rules are being observed.
These inspectors also keep a sharp lookout
for young girls and learn their
names and addresses. These names are
turned over the next morning to the
supervisor of police matrons who sends
one of her assistants to call on the parents
of the girl to inform them where
their daughter was the evening previous.
Many times the parents had not known
of the facts, or had been deceived by
the girls. Such supervision can but
bring about good results.</p>

<p>The Free Legal Aid Bureau averages
about 400 cases per month, prosecutes
wife deserters and has brought them in
many instances home from other states.
The Welfare Loan Agency during its
few months of existence has eliminated
several of those detestable misdemeanants,
loan sharks.</p>

<p>Perhaps I’ve spoken of many more
varieties of law-breakers than Dr. Lewis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
had in mind when he asked me to speak
a few moments on this subject, but it
was hard not to go a little further and
mention these different agencies which
are making some degree of progress
along this line in Kansas City.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ORGANIZATION_OF_SYSTEMS_OF_PROBATION">ORGANIZATION OF SYSTEMS OF PROBATION
AND PAROLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">CHARLES A. DE COWRCY</p>

<p class="center">Judge of the Superior Court, Massachusetts</p>


<p>The two essentials of success in probation
work are:—judges who have an
intelligent and sympathetic interest in
the problem, and probation officers fitted
by temperament and training to secure
the best possible results.</p>

<p>To further define these essentials, we
need judges who will not discredit the
system by extending probation to persons
not likely to profit by it, and who
will apply it wherever it can be done
with due regard to the protection of the
community, and where the past history
and present disposition of the person investigated
indicate that he may reasonably
be expected to reform without punishment.
And we need probation officers
who possess not only sympathy
and zeal, but knowledge of human nature,
tact, firmness and patience.</p>

<p>How shall we secure such judges and
officers? The active friends of probation
can influence public opinion in the
election or appointment of persons able
and willing to consider probation on its
merits. It is such a human problem that
it is difficult to conceive of a man otherwise
fitted for judicial position who will
not apply probation with intelligent sympathy
when its possibilities are called to
his attention.</p>

<p>But much can be done to secure uniform
standards and improved methods
by conferences among the judges, and
between them and the probation commission
of the State. These conferences
also enable those judges who have a
whole-souled interest in the work to enkindle
the enthusiasm of their associates.
This is all the more important in
the states where the judges appoint the
probation officers.</p>

<p>How to secure suitable probation officers
is the most important problem in
the probation system. In states where
judges are appointed for life, as in
Massachusetts, the method of appointment
by the judge under whom the officer
acts has worked well. But even
here are found some judges, happily few
in number, who persist in retaining officers
little adapted for the work. Where
judges persist in such conduct, after being
shown its blighting effect on probation
work in their district, it is usually
because the judge himself takes no interest
in probation. To prevent such injustice,
no appointment of a probation
officer by a judge should be effective
until the state probation commission,
after proper examination, certifies that
the candidate is qualified properly to
perform the duties of the office.</p>

<p>The New York system of a civil service
examination, specially adapted for
probation duties, has much to recommend
it. Whatever the method of selection,
no person should be appointed
who does not secure the approval of the
state board; and the board might well
be given power of removal, after a hearing,
upon written charges.</p>

<p>In the organization of a system of
probation an essential element is a central
state board. As probation is a part
of the judicial system, I favor the Massachusetts
method of having the members
of the board appointed by the chief
justice of the superior or trial court.
And if a majority of its members are
judges, the efforts of the board are most
likely to secure the co-operation of the
judges throughout the state.</p>

<p>The state board should have power to
prescribe forms of records and reports,
to suggest uniform and efficient methods
of work by the officers, and promote
co-ordination among them; and, in general,
it should have ample authority to
supervise the probation work throughout
the state. Where this central board
has also authority in the matter of appointments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and removals above mentioned,
the organization of the probation
system seems complete. In order
to maintain a high standard of probation
work, the executive officer of the
state board should periodically investigate
the work of every probation officer;
and there should be frequent conferences
of the judges and of the probation
officers conducted by members of the
state board.</p>

<p>As to the organization of a parole system—for
the present the machinery of
the probation system might well be utilized
for this work. The vital point in
parole work is the appointment of a suitable
board to determine to whom and
when parole shall be granted, and on
what terms. This question is closely
associated with the indeterminate sentence
and state control of prisons. I
have not had sufficient experience with
parole problems to make specific recommendations.</p>

<p>We should agree upon the meaning
of our terms. Probation and parole are
often used synonymously, while, in fact,
authorities and prison officials recognize
a distinction. Probation applies to one
conditionally released after conviction
but before entering upon his sentence.
Parole is understood to be the conditional
release of a prisoner from an institution
after the serving of sentence
has been begun.</p>

<p>In Indiana the law authorizes the
board of trustees acting as a parole
board, or the Governor, to release on
parole persons who have been confined
under commitment in five institutions:
the State Prison, the Reformatory, the
Woman’s Prison, Girls’ School and
Boys’ School; to all of these, sentences
are in effect indeterminate except for
murder or treason. Prisoners so released
are under supervision and accurate
records are kept.</p>

<p>The Indiana probation law applies in
three different ways, respectively, to
felons, to misdemeanors, to juvenile delinquents.
A person who is convicted
of a felony is sentenced to a state prison
or a reformatory. Sentence may be suspended
and he be released on probation.
The committal is sent to the institution
to which he is committed and he is
placed under the supervision of the
agents of that institution exactly the
same as if he were paroled therefrom.</p>

<p>If the offense is a misdemeanor, the
court may suspend judgment and release
the offender upon such terms and conditions
as in his judgment and discretion
seem right and proper. The prisoner
is placed under the supervision of
the probation officer authorized in each
county by the juvenile court law or
under the oversight of some other probation
officer designated by the court.
In either case the law makes proper provision
for such subsequent action by the
court as the behavior of the convicted
person merits.</p>

<p>The juvenile court law provides for
a juvenile court in every county in the
state. There is a special juvenile court
in Marion County, containing the city
of Indianapolis. In all other counties
the judge of the circuit court is ex-officio
the judge of the juvenile court.
Provision is made for the appointment
of at least one paid probation officer in
every county and for such volunteer officers
as will agree to perform the service
without pay.</p>

<p>Juvenile delinquents may be released
by the court upon probation and placed
under the care of these officers. They
make reports to the Board of State
Charities. They should understand
thoroughly that their work should properly
be divided into three phases: (1)
before the trial; (2) at the trial; (3)
after the trial. The first contemplates a
complete investigation of the child’s history.
It should include everything that
can be learned of it and its surroundings.
The second involves presenting to
the court all learned facts together with
the conclusions and recommendations of
the officer. The third contemplates
complete supervision of the child after it
is released upon probation. It is not
necessary to state that in all this the
best interests of the child alone should
determine the action to be taken. What
has been worked out in one place and
another as to the best methods and practice
in the case of children is being applied
to adults who are subjects for probation.
Our experience is now great
enough to enable us to say that many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
men and women offenders can be reclaimed
to useful lives without imprisonment,
by correct probationary treatment.</p>

<p><i>Immigration and Crime.</i>—That lax
immigration laws are to a great degree
responsible for many of the
criminal cases calling for the attention
of the courts, is the opinion of Major
Richard Sylvester, of Washington, D.
C., president of the international association
of police chiefs, which held its
nineteenth annual convention in Rochester
in June. Several years ago the
association memorialized Congress to define
anarchy and more carefully restrict
undesirable immigration.</p>

<p>Referring to the large number of alien
criminals, Major Sylvester said: “Many
of these subjects come from climates
where capital punishment does not prevail,
where the least respect for law and
life is had. If certificates of good character
from the authorities at places of
departure in foreign lands and a year’s
means of support were made legal requirements
for presentation at our doors
by each individual, the disadvantages
might not be so great or so many.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Hospitals For Inebriates.</i>—The special
committee of the New York
Board of Estimate and Apportionment
has unanimously reported in favor
of carrying into effect a law which provides
for the establishment of a board of
inebriety and a hospital and industrial
colony for inebriates for New York City.</p>

<p>The committee made an exhaustive investigation
of conditions before reaching
a conclusion. It found that the 29,461
persons arrested in New York last
year and arraigned in the magistrates’
courts on the charge of public intoxication
constituted more than one-sixth of
all the arrests made for all causes. The
records disclose that, of the 20,291 held
for trial, about 15,600 were committed to
workhouses, either directly or in default
of payment of fine. Commenting on
these and other statistics the report says:</p>

<p>Inebriety, therefore, furnishes a very
large percentage of those who keep the
police officers busy, clog the magistrates’
courts, and fill the workhouses and jails.
It furnishes also a very large number of
cases for treatment in our public hospitals.
Seven thousand male drunkards
are treated annually in the alcoholic ward
of Bellevue and allied hospitals. Carefully
compiled records show that in the
one year ended May 1, 1909, 498 men
were treated for intoxication more than
once in that ward, and over 100 from
four to twelve times, and that in the
course of a few years some individuals
have been treated in the alcoholic ward
over twenty times and have been committed
to the workhouse over sixty
times.</p>

<p>The committee does not overlook the
moral effects of the treatment of inebriates
under the plan which it has approved,
but it especially points out the
economic features. It finds that New
York is spending annually on Blackwell’s
Island the amount of $80,000 for
cases committed for intoxication, and in
addition there is the cost of two overflow
wards at Bellevue, amounting to
not less than $65,000 per annum. The
proportion of expenses in maintaining
magistrates’ courts chargeable to intoxication
is at least $125,000 a year, and
a large additional expense is incurred
in maintaining police officers for the city
prison and for the alcoholic wards in
hospitals. To use the language of the
report: “As a result of all these expenses
under the present system there is
a complete lack of accomplishment. There
is no pretense even that the individual
is helped; quite the contrary, he is rather
confirmed in his habits of inebriety and
is permanently fastened on the community
as an expense and as a bad example.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>A Prison Farm Proposed for Iowa.</i>—According
to the Dubuque, Iowa, Telegraph-Herald,
Warden Marquis Barr
of the Iowa State Reformatory, is of
the opinion that it would be a wise move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
for the state to purchase a large farm
and work the prisoners upon it, turning
the money which they make over to their
respective families. He declares that
this age must solve the great problem
of justly punishing a man for his wrongs
without at the same time taking from
his family its only means of support.</p>

<p>The logical thing for a state to do is
to purchase a farm of about a thousand
acres, with barracks for the prisoners to
eat and sleep in. Over one-third of the
men in the prisons of Iowa could be
set to work upon this farm, raising grains
and garden truck. They could be paid
a certain wage and board in the same
manner as the farmer pays his hired
help, but every cent of these earnings
should be turned over to the wife and
children of the man who earns it. Not a
penny should be given to him.</p>

<p>Warden Barr also said that he believed
that if men knew that they would be
compelled to work and work hard at a
fair wage without themselves getting a
penny of it, that there would be less
crime. Many men during the fall commit
crimes solely for the purpose of getting
a warm place to stay during the
winter and three good meals per day.
They allow their families to shift for
themselves. For the state to encourage
this sort of a thing Mr. Barr says is absolutely
wrong.</p>

<p><i>Charting Juvenile Crime.</i>—The juvenile
court of Detroit is reported
to be greatly assisted in its campaign
of saving girls and boys, by a
chart which shows how many children
are under the watchful care of the judge
and his probation and truant officers,
and how crime recedes and advances
among the young at different seasons of
the year; also what effect a big convention
has on the city’s morality, and how
greatly parks and playgrounds help in
the fight for decency.</p>

<p>The 600 boys and 170 girls are represented
on the chart by cloth-headed tacks
of different colors: red for bad boys,
blue for bad girls, and white for children
who are only truants or neglected. Each
tack bears a bit of cardboard with a
number which refers one to a filing cabinet
where may be found the entire record
of the boy or girl. Little groups of
dots on the chart show where the gangs
are, and indicate that bad boys are more
gregarious than bad girls, who usually
go alone or in couples. The chart also
shows more plainly than any magazine
article the evil results of congestion. The
probation officers are not using this chart
as an interesting sort of game, but as a
valuable aid in their work for good citizenship.</p>

<p><i>London’s Beggar Army.</i>—Walter
Weyl, a well-known writer on social
and economic subjects, has the following
to say in the “National Post” on
London’s army of the unemployed. It is
of special significance to Americans who
are facing the impending problems of
vagrancy and mendicancy in urban centers.</p>

<p>“As I started to call a cab,” writes
Walter Weyl, “suddenly there arose out
of the darkness, as though evoked by
some Aladdins lamp, four tattered, pale-faced
men of the underworld. The four
sprang forward to render me this slight
service. One, quicker than his fellows,
tore open the cab door and received his
penny. Then the men vanished, slinking
into the gray mist.</p>

<p>“Whence come these men? What
manner of city was this that wasted able-bodied
men on so paltry a task?</p>

<p>“Later that evening, when in the crossing
currents of the streets, my cab came
to a halt, I caught another fleeting glance
at London misery. A naked, dirt-caked
arm, thrust from a sleeveless coat,
touched my shoulder; a haggard face
peered into the cab window, and a voice
harsh with anxiety asked, ‘Can I ’ave
the luggage, sir?’ As the cab wound
through the mazes of the London traffic,
I saw this tattered man doggedly
running behind us. Not once did he lose
sight of the cab. At the hotel he was
waiting, breathless.</p>

<p>“‘It’s mine, sir,’ he panted. ‘You
promised me the luggage, sir.’</p>

<p>“For the chance of earning a shilling
at work which did not need him, this
wretched man had followed me through
tortuous miles of London streets. What
a city it was!</p>

<p>“I did not wish to see deeper into this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
abyss,” writes Mr. Weyl. “I had not
come to England to view bottomless
misery. But what is everywhere cannot
be hid. On the following days I saw in
street after street workless, homeless
miserable men with broken shoes and
dropping rags of clothes. I saw abject
women, with trailing, bedraggled skirts,
and with a flat sterile vacancy of expression,
more tragic than despair. There
were drunken men, too, and sodden
women, and files of men—or of what
had once been men—waiting outside bakers’
and butchers’ shops for crusts and
refuse. The halt, the blind, the unemployed,
the shifty beggars, and the
wretches too timid to beg, passed in an
unending procession. Long before sunset
the lines had been formed for admission
to the casual wards of the almshouses.</p>

<p>“‘It’s deplorable,’ commented my English
friend (he was a doctor with a fashionable
practice and aristocratic pro-possessions),
‘still every country has its poverty.
Even in the States——’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I admitted, ‘It is not for us
to throw stones.’</p>

<p>“Later, however, as on our silent
homeward walk I summed up all the dismal
impressions of the day. I began to
feel that after all there was a difference.
American poverty was overwhelming,
but it was not everywhere, and it was not
so hopeless. Men did escape from American
slums, and their children escaped.</p>

<p>“But the English slum was a prison,
in which the fallen man and his children
and grandchildren rotted. There was a
droop, a sagging to these people; an inexpressible
indifference to surroundings,
an utter self-abandonment. You could
seek out poverty anywhere, but in London
it obtruded itself—stark, menacing,
unescapable, like the naked, dirt-caked
arm of the superfluous wretch who had
followed my hansom.”</p>

<p><i>Prisoners to Build Roads.</i>—It is
an assured fact, according to the New
Orleans Picayune, that a model road
built by convict labor will be constructed
connecting New Orleans with Kenner.
This will take off four miles from the
present railroad and other routes to this
thriving section.</p>

<p>The state board of engineers will
make the surveys as soon as possible
and once started the work will be rapidly
pushed.</p>

<p>Nothing but the best material will be
used, and the drainage of the roadway
will be given attention. It is expected
either shells or some other substantial
“topping” will be put on the thoroughfare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New Jersey Adopts the State-Use Plan.</i>—By
the signing by Governor Wilson,
the bill abolishing the present system of
convict labor at the termination of the
existing state prison contracts, all convict
labor in the state and county prisons
in New Jersey may be employed in the
manufacture of articles for use in the
institutions of the state and its subdivisions.
The convicts are to be employed
for nine hours, except on Sundays and
public holidays. They may be employed
in the construction or repair of prison
institutions, and the labor of the convicts
must be so directed as to produce “the
greatest amount of actual product of
articles and supplies” for all state and
local institutions, the buildings and departments
or offices of the state, “or in
any public institution or department
owned, managed and controlled by the
state or public sub-division thereof.”
Convicts may be employed in agriculture,
horticulture and floriculture, and “all
surplus product of this convict labor is
to be disposed of at public sale to the
highest bidder.” The new law extends
the prison labor system from the state
prison to all county prisons, and makes
city and county departments, offices and
institutions, as well as the state institutions,
its beneficiaries. The sum of 50
cents a day is to be paid to the families
of the convicts.</p>

<p><i>Parole in Maryland.</i>—That Maryland
will save at least $5,000 a
year in earnings through the institution
of the modern practice of paroling
prisoners is stated by Charles D. Reid,
of the Maryland Prisoners’ Aid Society.
Heretofore in Maryland the practice has
been but seldom resorted to in this state,
with the result, says Mr. Reid, of failure
to suppress crime, loss to the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and failure to encourage right living
among the criminal class.</p>

<p>“Last year,” said Mr. Reid, “the
amount of money taken in by fathers of
families who have been paroled and thus
saved in resource to the state was only
$600. The parole system was then
started by arrangement between Judge
Duffy and myself. Already in one month
$400 has been saved and the prospects
are that at least $5,000 will be saved during
the year.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Uncle Sam and His Delinquents.</i>—According
to the Meriden (Conn.)
Journal, modern and advanced ideas upon
penology will be introduced into the army
method of handling garrison prisoners,
according to orders just issued by Major
General Leonard Wood, chief of
staff. The new regulations will not apply
to military convicts, but only to those
sentenced to confinement and hard labor
without being discharged from the service.</p>

<p>The purpose behind the new regulations
is to give the prisoner every opportunity
to make good, instead of discouraging
all effort toward good behavior.
Under the new orders, garrison prisoners
will be allowed an abatement of five
days of their terms of confinement for
each period of twenty-five days of good
conduct, when serving sentences of one
month and not more than three months.
On sentences exceeding three months
they will be allowed the five days’ abatement
for the first month, and thereafter
ten days abatement for each period of
twenty days’ good conduct. Abatements
thus authorized may be forfeited wholly
or in part by subsequent misconduct.</p>

<p>A garrison prisoner who has served
one half of a sentence of ten days or
more, according to the new orders, may
submit a request to be put on probation
for the remainder of the sentence, and if
his request is granted, may be restored
to duty on condition that if his conduct
is not good while on probation he will
be required to serve the remainder of his
sentence.</p>

<p>The new orders also make important
changes in the methods of working garrison
prisoners at military posts. These
changes have been outlined in the following
letter, sent to the commanders of the
several departments:</p>

<p>“The present system of working prisoners
under sentinels conveys a false impression
as to the character of the prisoners,
gives the public the erroneous idea
that the army is full of bad characters
requiring forcible handling, is injurious
to the self-respect of the prisoners, discourages
enlistments, and lowers the military
service in public opinion. In addition
to these objections, the system constitutes
a heavy drain upon the command
furnishing the necessary guard.</p>

<p>“It is deemed advisable and in the interests
of the service, to adopt a different
method of handling these garrison prisoners
who are confined for comparatively
short periods of time, to the end
that the fewest practicable number of
prisoners may be required to work under
guard.</p>

<p>“It is therefore directed that as far as
is practicable, as may be determined by
post commanders in accordance with the
above policy, garrison prisoners will be
paroled for work under the general supervision
of the officer or non-commissioned
officer in charge of prisoners; and
that prisoners whose character of offenses
are of such a nature as to require
that they be kept under armed guard
shall be assigned tasks, as far as practicable,
which will make the presence in
the service of this class of men as little
conspicuous as possible.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Convicts to Build Road.</i>—“The State
of Utah,” according to a statement
of Major M. P. Hackett, of Ogden,
“is going to build an improved highway,
500 miles in length, stretching
clear across Utah to Idaho at one end,
and to the Arizona boundary at the
other. The road is to be built entirely
<i>with</i> convict labor, in accordance with a
late law authorizing such use of the
felons.</p>

<p>“But there is a humane side to the
enterprise, that may well be copied by
other states. For every day’s work performed
by the men each will have one
day subtracted from his sentence. To a
convict who is in for a long time this
deduction is of big importance and it will
be a great inducement for them to toil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
cheerfully and to the best of their ability.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>A Report From Texas Prisons.</i>—A
statement has been recently made by
Ben. E. Cabell, chairman of the board
of prison commissioners of Texas, that
at this time Texas has between 600
and 700 prisoners at Huntsville and Rusk
within the walls, and about 1,100 on her
own state farms. About 1,000 are on
share farms, where the state supplies the
labor and gets part of the crop.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the year about
800 convicts were being worked on farms
and railroads. Within the last thirty
days the railroad contracts have expired
and have not been renewed. Some of
the men were moved within the walls and
others sent to the farms owned by the
state. The present commissioners are in
thorough harmony with Gov. Colquitt,
who made it known that he wanted the
contract and share farm system abolished
as soon as practicable, and that all the
convicts should be worked on state account.
To this end the prison commissioners
gave notice to all whose contracts
expired with the end of this year that
the contracts would not be renewed. This
will leave very few men on share farms
and none on contracts at the end of this
year.</p>

<p>“The state has about 10,000 acres of
land beside the 17,000 now in cultivation.
This 10,000 acres will be put in cultivation
for the year 1912. It is the intention
of the prison commission (and has already
been done) to put the farms and
farm buildings in first-class condition, to
make the buildings comfortable and
healthful, to have good sanitation and
wholesome conditions and all reasonable
arrangements for the comfort of the
convicts.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New York’s Campaign For a Farm
Colony.</i>—The “farm colony plan” has
progressed further toward success in this
year’s session of the legislature than
ever before. For several years charitable
and correctional organizations have
urged the state legislature to establish
a farm and industrial colony for tramps
and vagrants. At the present writing
the bill has passed the lower house and
is now in the order of third reading in
the senate. Governor Dix is reported to
have stated frequently his interest in
this bill.</p>

<p>The bill, which has general interest in
all states where the farm colony plan has
been contemplated, provides for a state
industrial farm colony for the detention,
humane discipline, instruction and reformation
of male adults committed
thereto as tramps or vagrants. The colony
shall be under the control and management
of a board of seven managers, to
serve without compensation. The board
shall appoint the superintendent and
other employes, establish rules and regulations
including the classification, parole,
discharge and retaking of inmates.
The board shall, if possible, utilize lands
now owned by the state, if such lands
are suitable as a site for the state farm
colony. In case no lands now owned by
the state are found to be suitable, the
board of managers shall select a site of
not less than 500 acres. The term of detention
in the colony shall be not longer
than 18 months with the exception that
an inmate who has been manifestly committed
to an institution after the age of
16 may be detained not longer than two
years. There is no minimum term of
commitment, nor shall any person under
the age of 22 be committed to said colony.
A significant clause in the act provides
that it is the intent and meaning
of this act that reputable workmen, temporarily
out of work and seeking employment,
shall not be deemed tramps or
vagrants, nor be admitted to the said colony.
Persons committed as vagrants to
the farm shall be local charges, and those
committed as tramps shall be maintained
at the expense of the state. In no event
shall any locality be charged a greater
amount for the care of vagrants than the
actual per capita cost for their maintenance
in such state industrial farm colony.</p>

<p>An excellent campaign of publicity has
been carried on this year for this bill by
the charity organization society, and the
association for improving the condition
of the poor in New York through their
joint application bureau. Rarely has any
bill before the legislature found so much
favor in editorials and news columns.</p>

<p><i>Hospitals for Inebriates.</i>—The special

reported in favor of carrying
into effect a law which provides for the

a hospital and industrial colony for inebriates

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The New York Times recently published
the following book review:</p>

<p><i>Tramps in the Making.</i>—“The laboratory
method in philanthropic work has
never had more signal demonstration
than in Alice Willard Solenberger’s
“One Thousand Homeless Men,” (New
York: Charities Publication Committee,
$1.25) a study of original methods in
the true scientific manner and spirit.
The author was for four years in charge
of a district of the Chicago Bureau of
Charities and during that time compiled,
in the regular course of her work, the
statistics whose analysis and discussion
make up this work. She endeavored also
to trace the later histories of her subjects
and, whenever this was possible,
she had included it in her data. Mrs.
Solenberger’s untimely death, before she
had written the final chapter in which
she has purposed to sum up the conclusions
to which she had been led by her
long study and intimate knowledge of
the homeless-man problem, lessens somewhat
the interest of her book for the
general reader. But her analysis of her
tables of statistics and her discussions of
the inferences to be drawn from them
are so lucid and so practical that philanthropic
workers will find the volume valuable
alike for its facts and for its suggestions.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most striking of the
phases of the vagrancy problem brought
out by Mrs. Solenberger’s figures is the
extent to which it is a native problem.
Of the group of confirmed tramps, more
than a fifth of the whole number of cases
studied, 76 per cent. are native born. Of
the vagrant runaway boys, nearly all
were born on American soil and of
American parents. The chapter devoted
to these boys is particularly notable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
its sympathetic but level-headed treatment
of the causes which lead to boyish
vagrancy, of its results, and of the methods
by which it might be combined.
Among these methods she thinks the
most important would be the satisfying
of adolescent “wanderlust” by normal,
wholesome means and the closing of the
railways to vagrants.</p>

<p>“Indeed the whole tramp problem she
believes could be well-nigh solved if vagrants
of all ages could be kept off railway
trains. It has been estimated by
several authorities, working independently,
that there are in the United States
at least half a million tramps. In her
book Mrs. Solenberger studies the genesis,
character, and previous environment
of 220, and comes to the conclusion
that in the huge army of which
these are typical examples the variations
of character and of inducing causes are
so great that they call for much variety
in methods of treatment. But the basic
characteristic of all of them is the abnormal
propensity for incessant wandering.</p>

<p>“‘It is the mere accessibility of the
railroads, more than anything else,’ she
writes, ‘that is manufacturing tramps today.
* * * When we succeed in absolutely
closing these highways to any
but persons having a legitimate right to
be on them, we shall check at its source
the largest single contributary cause of
vagrancy, and the problem of the tramps,
as such, will practically be solved.’</p>

<p>“She thinks the problem should be
dealt with by states, and that if several
of the most populous and most tramp-ridden
would deal with it adequately, for
which she makes a number of practical
suggestions, the rest would be driven, in
self-defense, to follow their example.</p>

<p>“Other subjects treated by this same
scientific method of study of actual
cases, with all the preceding and following
data that could be gathered, and
then discussed in their general implications,
are chronic beggars, seasonal and
casual labor, interstate migration of
paupers, homeless old men, the crippled,
the defective, and industrial accidents.
A number of appendices contain much
statistical information and some articles
on lodging houses. The book is published
under the auspices of the Russell
Sage Foundation.”</p>
